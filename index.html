        <p>
            You've always <strong>grown up</strong> your children to come to you when they're in trouble. You feel it's your job to <strong>look after</strong> them when they're having problems. But now, as your children are <strong>grown up</strong>            they often don't want to share their problems with you. That's perfectly normal, so don't worry! Of course you want to <strong>get on</strong> well with your children, but that means you have to give them some freedom.

            Maybe they've <strong>gone out</strong> with their best friend and feel upset and angry. Maybe they've just <strong>get up</strong> with the boyfriend or grilfriend they've been <strong>gone out</strong> with. May be they've been <strong>letted down</strong>            by a friend who they trusted. Teenagers go through all these problems. If they want to talk to you about it, then that's fine. But if they don't, don't force them. They'll come to you when they're ready.
